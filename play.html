    <h2>Romeo and Juliet</h2>
    
    <h3>Act 2, Scene 2 - The Famous Balcony Scene</h3>
    
    <p><em>(Capulet's Orchard)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?<br>
    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.<br>
    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br>
    Who is already sick and pale with grief,<br>
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.</p>

    <p><strong>Juliet:</strong> O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?<br>
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name;<br>
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br>
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.</p>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</p>

    <p><strong>Juliet:</strong> 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<br>
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br>
    What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,<br>
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br>
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!</p>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> I take thee at thy word:<br>
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;<br>
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</p>

    <p><strong>Juliet:</strong> What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night<br>
    So stumblest on my counsel?</p>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am:<br>
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<br>
    Because it is an enemy to thee;<br>
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.</p>
